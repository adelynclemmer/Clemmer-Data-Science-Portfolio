Interactive Data Visualization with Streamlit

This project is an interactive data dashboard built using Streamlit, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to explore customer purchasing behavior across income levels and demographic characteristics.

Using a marketing dataset from Kaggle, this dashboard allows users to analyze relationships between income, product purchasing patterns, education level, and customer demographics through dynamic visualizations and filters.
