Interactive Customer Preference Data Visualization with Streamlit

This project is an interactive data dashboard built with Streamlit, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to explore customer purchasing behavior across income levels while also understanding the underlying demographic characteristics of the consumer.

The data was obtained using a marketing set that was hoping to uncover "a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers." The purpose of this project is to analyze customer purchasing behavior using demographic and income-based filters. It seems to use multiple forms of charts and grids, to allow users to interact with the dataset to explore patterns in it.
